  <p>My Love,</p>
  
  <p>I know everything happened so fast—ang bilis ng pacing natin. And yet here we are, celebrating our <b>first monthsary</b>. Just one month in, but it already feels like I’ve known you for lifetimes.</p>
  
  <p>I know I haven’t always been able to give you the kind of quality time you truly deserve. But please know, mahal, I’m constantly trying. Every free second—I think of you. You matter to me in ways words can barely capture.</p>
  
  <p>No amount of poetry or grand gestures could fully express how much I adore you. From the curve of your smile, the softness in your voice, to the way you make me feel truly seen—you leave me in awe every single time. It’s hard to explain, but just being near you, or even the thought of you, brings a sense of calm I’ve never known before. You feel like home—but elevated, like a five-star suite with a view of the universe.</p>
  
  <p>You deserve a love that is abundant, intentional, and unwavering. A love that doesn’t just fill your heart, but overflows—so pure, so sure, that you’ll never have to question your worth. Because mahal, you are rare. You are valuable. You are irreplaceable.</p>
  
  <p>Happy first monthsary, my love. Here’s to more memories, soft laughter, quiet mornings, and loud kiligs. Here's to us—evolving, healing, loving endlessly, and choosing each other every single day.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Endlessly yours,</p>
  <p><b>Kyeji Nakazawa</b></p>
